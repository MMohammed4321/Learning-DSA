# Learning-DSA
These will be my notes on Data Structures and Algorithms.
This is also a little side project of mine so that I can properly understand DSA and hopefully help others too
Please make sure to try to contact me if anything is incorrect and I understand code style may not be great.
This is currently still a work in progress and I try to implement this in more languages but for not it is in python.
Thank you for your time
